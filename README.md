# Hello there! 👋

I'm an experienced UX designer with a deep passion for exploring new ideas and crafting unique solutions. Here’s a little about what makes me tick:

- 🚀 **Innovative at Heart:** I thrive on testing new concepts and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in design.
- 🎨 **Creative Solutions:** Custom, unconventional approaches are my specialty. I love turning complex problems into simple, elegant user experiences.
- 📊 **Data Driven:** I have a strong affinity for working with data, using insights to drive better design decisions.
- 📝 **Content Creator:** Currently, I run a blog and newsletter focused on UX, all in Polish. Stay tuned as I plan to expand these into English!
- 🔗 **Open Source Enthusiast:** The open source community fascinates me, and I'm always eager to contribute and collaborate.

Feel free to explore my projects and don't hesitate to connect if you want to talk design, data, or anything in between!
